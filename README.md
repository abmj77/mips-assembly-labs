# Assembly Language Labs

## Goal of This Work:
These projects (Labs) were developed for the **Computer Architecture** course and aim to build a **practical understanding of Assembly programming using the MIPS architecture** by applying core concepts such as:
- Executing low-level instructions
- Working with registers and memory
- Handling input and output
- Controlling program flow
- Writing and calling procedures
- Using loops and arrays
- Working with floating-point numbers

These labs were completed during university studies as part of hands-on learning in low-level programming and computer architecture fundamentals.

## This Work Is Considered Successful If:
- Each Lab is clearly and briefly explained
- Attached files for each Lab are described
- The execution method is clearly explained
- Required tools and setup are listed
- The content is organized with clear, readable headings
- The explanation follows a simple, educational style without unnecessary technical complexity

## How to Run
1. Open the Assembly files using a MIPS simulator (such as MARS).
2. Load the desired `.asm` file.
3. Run the program from within the simulator.
4. Provide input values if required and observe the output.

---

## Requirements
- MIPS simulator (such as **MARS**)
- Environment that supports Assembly files
- Basic understanding of Computer Architecture and MIPS instructions

---

## Example Executions
- Reading integer input from the user and displaying results
- Using loops to process data
- Performing calculations with integer or floating-point values
